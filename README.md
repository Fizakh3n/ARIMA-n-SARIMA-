🚀 Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA & SARIMA: Retail Sales Dataset📊<br>
.
.
•I’ve been working on a time series forecasting task using a retail sales dataset with features like sales, stock, and price. Time series forecasting is crucial for businesses, helping predict future trends based on historical data.
.
.
 •I used ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast sales, and here’s a quick summary!<br>

.

🔍 What Are ARIMA and SARIMA?<br>
•ARIMA: Best for data without seasonality. It predicts trends based on previous values and errors.<br>
•SARIMA: An extended version of ARIMA that captures seasonal patterns in the data.<br>

💡 Application on My Retail Dataset<br>
•My dataset includes columns for sales, stock, price, and date. I applied ARIMA first but found SARIMA performed better due to the seasonality in sales patterns (monthly cycles).<br>

📊 Results<br>
•ARIMA gave an MSE of 3721.76 and MAE of 43.68.<br>
•SARIMA performed better with an MSE of 3392.55 and MAE of 41.26.<br>
•SARIMA was more accurate in capturing the recurring sales patterns, helping generate more precise forecasts for stock management and pricing strategies.<br>

🔑 Key Points to Remember:<br>
•Stationarity: Always check if your data is stationary before applying ARIMA. Use differencing if necessary.<br>
•Seasonality Detection: If seasonal patterns are present, SARIMA is a better choice!<br>
•Evaluation Metrics: Use MSE and MAE to measure model accuracy. Lower is better!<br>
•Time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA are invaluable in making informed decisions for inventory and pricing. I’ve learned a lot through this dataset and can’t wait to apply these insights to real-world problems. 🔥<br>
